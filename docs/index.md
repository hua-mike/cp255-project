## Introduction

In San Francisco, CA, there are around 30 traffic deaths and over 500 serious injuries each year. The City of SF, like many cities around the world, is pursuing a Vision Zero goal to have zero traffic deaths. Painted crosswalks are among the most basic forms of pedestrian infrastructure. Adding crosswalks is listed in SF's Vision Zero plan as a low-cost measure to increase safety.

## Discussion

From my initial analysis of the crosswalk audit data, its clear that there are spatial disparities in marked crosswalks. Northern areas of the city typically have more intersections with fully marked crosswalks than the southern areas of the city.

As seen in the mapping by supervisor district, intersections in the southern part of SF are much less likely to have painted crosswalks. The disparity by supervisor district might also allude to differences in political power of districts to get infrastructure improvements, but further analysis would be needed there.
